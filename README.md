# The Double Pendulum
This is python code I wrote to simulate and analyze several interesting properties of the double pendulum. For many of them you find a corresponding video on my youtube channel:

## Detailed tutorial of a pendulum simulation in pythonpendulum.ipynb
The file `pendulum.ipynb` is a detailed tutorial style code about how you can simulate and render a single pendulum using basic python libraries. The corresponding video on youtube is

## Inverted single/double pendulum
If you want to train your own software agent that learns to balance the inverted pendulum (single or double) you can use the code `inverted_pendulum.ipynb`. In the last cell you find all the hyperparameters explained that you can change. Corresponding youtube video:

## Sound of the double pendulum
You can use the file `sound_of_doublependulum.ipynb` to simulate a double pendulum and then play and visualize the corresponding sound that is generated by interpretating the pendulum's motion as a sound wave. I hope the individual cells of the code are self explaining enough. Corresponding youtube video:
